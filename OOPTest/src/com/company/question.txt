The purpose of the application is to help a ficticious company called Bills Burger to manage
thier process of selling hamburgers.
Our application will help Bill to select types of burgers, some of the additional items (additions) to
be added to the burgers and pricing
we want to create a base hamburger. but also two two other types of hamburgers that are popular ones in
Bills store.
The basic hamburger should have the following items.
bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tommato carrot, etc) that
the customer can select to be added to the burger. Each one of these items gets charged an additional price
so you need way to track how many items got added and to calculate the price ( for the base
burger and all the additions).
This burger has a base price and the additions are all seperately priced.
Create a Hamburger class to deal with all the above.
The constructor should only include the roll type,meat and price.
Also create two extra varities of Hamburgers (classes) to cater for
a) Healthy burger(on a bran rye bread roll), plus two addition item to be added.
The healthy burger can have a total of 6 items(Addition ) in total.
hint: you probably want to process the 2 additional items items in this new class, no the base class,
since the 2 additions are appropriate for this new class.
b) Deluxe hamburger - comes with chips and drinks as additions, but no extra additions are allowed.
hint : You hvae to find a way to automatically and these new additions at the time at the time the deluxe burger
object is created, and thn prevent other additions being made.
All 3 classes should have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of haburger
plus all additionals, each showing the addition nae, and addition rice, and a grand total for the
burger
for the two additional classes this may require yu to be looking at the base class for pricing and then
adding totals onto that.
